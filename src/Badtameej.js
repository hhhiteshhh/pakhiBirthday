            she breathes like a storm, she talks like fire
            <br />
            she walks an attitude, that you can't just hire <br />
            <br />
            she breaks all the rules, she makes her own story <br />
            you keep pointing fingers, but she will go for her glory
            <br />
            <br />
            she has a sharp tongue, but her heart is gold <br />
            new are her ways, but her soul is old <br />
            <br />
            she is a little like this little like that, and little more too
            <br />
            you will never know her, she is a sea she is the shore too .<br />

            You are the best, I keep on annoying you but you still manage to
            deal with me every single time. Sometimes I become a kid who
            constantly needs your attention, Sometimes I become a mature person,
            Sometimes I act dumb, Sometimes I become sad, Sometimes I don't
            believe in myself, Sometimes I lose my confidence, Sometimes I get
            very negative, But you keep on supporting me at every stage. Having
            you by my side is the best thing that ever happened to me!

            Sisters are a gift that we keep unwrapping over the years as we
            discover more layers of her care, love, and prayers. She always acts
            a little devil. But honestly, her love for you is always too pure to
            be lost in her slaps and taunts. A mini mother, a cute monster,
            that's your sister.

            Dear sister, You are my bestest friend, the first person with whom I
            shared everyday news. We have fought so much, but we have always
            loved each other more. I treasure you. But I don't tell you this. I
            don't know why.<b> You are an idiot.</b> So maybe that's I don't
            tell you this. But I love, a lot, a hell lot.

            She was not a cute flower, you can pluck off
            <br /> She was a wild fire, and she sang fuck off

            <br /> No pickups lines for her, she trolled them bad
            <br />
            The guys came up smiling, and cried back sad
            <br />
            <br /> She never said aww, she never messaged heart
            <br /> A middle finger and bitch, were her favourite part.

            Dear Sister, I never tell you how much I love you. I always end up
            making fun of you. But I wanna tell you today that I notice
            everything. I notice your care, your love, your efforts, and your
            sacrifices. I remember every time you supported me, every time you
            prayed for me. We have shared so much together, but I never really
            sat you down and said thank you. So maybe this is my thanks to you,
            for everything that you have done for me. I do realize it. I just
            can't say it. I don't know why. Okay now, love you, bye.
