          Dear not-by-blood-sister who I haven't met yet,
          <br /> <br />
          Today is your day, but I also have a reason to celebrate. Today is the
          day my biggest strength, my shoulder to cry on, and my missing piece
          of the puzzle was brought into this world. Today is your birthday.
          <br /> <br />
          Even though I don’t need a special occasion like this to realize that
          I couldn’t imagine my life without you in it, this is the day that I
          simply have to tell you how much you mean to me. And that is exactly
          why I am writing this birthday letter to you – to wish you all the
          best and remind you that I love you, even though I don’t say it as
          often as I should.
          <br /> <br />
          You are one of the most important part of my life, living a life so
          different than mine. Thank god for technology that makes us feel like
          we are only seconds apart. But isn't it funny how we are closer right
          now than the people who are living 10 minutes away? Maybe that's why
          they say "distance makes the heart grow fonder”. Instead of harping on
          our trouble with time and how a teleportation device should have been
          in place by now, I'd like to throw some light on how I actually kind
          of enjoy this distance. <br /> <br /> Obviously, because I know it's
          not permanent since we’ll be meet each other soon. I look forward to
          our FaceTime more than my real ones. Not to mention the exquisite
          chocolates and fancy shoes you going to buy me.
          <br /> <br />
          And when someone think of the traditional definition of the best bond
          ever, people automatically think of someone they've known all their
          life, someone they have grown up together with. Well, we haven't. You
          and I don’t go far back. I hadn't known what you looked like when you
          were a pudgy toddler or a snarky 13-year-old. I haven't spent more
          nights in your childhood bedroom than my own, and your parents
          probably don't think of me as a second son. But you and I are special
          in our own way. We may have been oblivious to each other's existence
          for the first 18 years of our lives, but instead of trying to play
          catch-up we decided to take the time that lay ahead of us and make it
          our own. You may have no idea what my landline number is but I'm
          number one on your cell phone's speed dial. You may never have read my
          diary and yet you carry every sing|e one of my secrets. We’ve taught
          each other to be reckless, we’ve taught each other to be responsible.
          We've pushed each other for one more shot, we've held each other’s
          hair after. We‘ve experienced adventure, magic and love and we've
          grappled with loss, rejection and criticism. And through all of this,
          we've built each other up. You’re my constant reminder that you don’t
          have to know someone forever to know them. And we may not have grown
          up together, but we deflnitely have grown. And that, I love the most.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          And when people ask me why this is the best relationship to have, I
          don't know what to say. Would our bond be stronger if we spent more
          time around? I don't know. I do miss you at odd moments, but the fact
          that you are always a call away is hope enough. I am not fond of human
          interaction and you know that too well. With you, I find home. It
          doesn't matter if I am away for too long. I know it'll feel the same.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          Someone once told me that words are easy to be shared because they
          seldom carry meaning in today's world. It is the silence we share with
          people that speaks volumes about our comfort. <br /> <br />
          There are people in my life who I see, talk to and share time with,
          each and every day without fail. They know my coffee habits and
          remember the sound of my walk too well. But they don't come even close
          to the intimacy I share with you. I love how we have an unending list
          of stories and gossip to narrate to each other at the drop of a hat.
          Moreover, you not being around makes me want to live an experience a
          little more than usual so that I have more details to describe to you.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          If only I could send you a picture of my wide grin when I see your
          name flash on my phone screen; but l think you’ve already imagined it!{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          Anyway, I still miss you like an idiot who misses the point. <br />{" "}
          <br />
          Can't wait to see your pixelated face.

          She came into my life as a stranger <br />
          It was an abrupt 'hi’ followed by my obsession to become her brother
          <br />
          By reciting my useless shayaris/poetries i made her feel like the most
          special girl
          <br />
          I was surprised by her efforts she made to make me smile as at that
          time my life was in deep swirl
          <br />
          The tinkle boo actually belong to zoo <br />
          She's such a darling personality that she gets everyone's applaud
          <br />
          She can make anyone smile without seeking their accord
          <br />
          One can't resist from feeling happy in her presence she's such a
          sweetheart
          <br />
          She doesn't wears specs and is not much tall
          <br />
          But with her quirky acts stands apart in the hall
          <br />
          No matter she's single but her big heart has lots of love for all
          <br />
          You know what? She knows magic
          <br />
          You'll love every picture even if she create tragic
          <br />
          Her adorable smile has several hues and perfectly exhibit that she's
          dynamic
          <br />
          Not everyone knows but food can change her mood in just a flick
          <br />
          To be honest I couldn't ever feel so blessed without her
          <br />
          Today I pray that you live happily and bad times shall not take time
          to flee
          <br />
          Also I wish, you become such a successful that like you people dream
          to be!!!
          <br />
          Happy birthday Pakhi!!!... ❤❤❤
